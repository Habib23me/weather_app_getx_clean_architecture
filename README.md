Weather flutter project

## Getting Started

1. First and only step is to create a new .env file on the root folder and include openweathermap api-key with 'WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY' parameter name
2. Launch the project and get your weather stats

## Getting Started
1. I have used GetX state management with Clean Architecture principle as it provides the codebase to be organized into discrete modules, promots code clarity and maintainability. I tried to observe SOLID pricincple to reduce coupling as much as possible for the given scope
2. The challenges I have faced was initially choosing the best pattern for the requirement of the project
3. Potential improvemnts include using dartz package instead of tuples (Didn't want to go to functional programming), and using freezed for models for immutablity of models
